// The Components Folder is where I put smaller sections of bigger reusable sections.
// For example, say our header has dropdowns, I would normally create a _dropdown.scss file to house all the CSS related to that one component.
// What this does is make mantaining your project as you build it out A TON EASIER. Like holy shit man, Ive built a ton of sites with just plain
// css files, and it gets extremely hard to know what you need to edit, really really fast. If you had a file for each thing that seems like its own
// individual idea, its hard to NOT know what file you need to fuck with to make the necessary changes.
